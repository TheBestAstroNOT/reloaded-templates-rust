## Migration Guides

!!! important "Migration Order"
    If you need to migrate across multiple versions, please follow the migration guides in chronological order.
    
    Each guide assumes you have completed all previous migrations.

For information about migrating between template versions, see the following guides:

- **[v1.0.0](v1.0.0.md)** - Migrate from pre-v1 versions to v1.0.0
