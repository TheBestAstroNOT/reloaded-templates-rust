# VSCode Integration

While Rust is wonderful to work with- getting started with the tooling can be a bit daunting- everything's all over.

The Reloaded Project Template provides sane defaults for VSCode (Visual Studio Code) integration,
including testing, code coverage, and professional Rust development workflows.

## Quick Start

Install the recommended VSCode extensions:

- [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer) - Essential Rust language server providing IDE features (required for VSCode development)
- [Coverage Gutters](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ryanluker.vscode-coverage-gutters) - Visualize code coverage in your editor
- [Crates](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=serayuzgur.crates) - Manage crate dependencies and versions

!!! info
    Coverage tools are automatically installed when you first run coverage tasks.

## Workspace Structure

The Reloaded template is designed to work with separate VSCode workspaces for different purposes:

### Source Code Development (`src`)

Open the `src` folder in VSCode when doing Rust development work. This folder contains your `Cargo.toml`, source code, and tests. When opened as your workspace root, VSCode features work automatically:

- CodeLLDB debug profiles generate automatically
- Ctrl+Shift+B build task runs without configuration
- rust-analyzer provides full IDE features
- All development tasks are immediately available

### Documentation Editing (`doc`)

Open the `doc` folder in VSCode when editing documentation. This folder contains your MkDocs project and markdown files. The doc workspace uses different VSCode settings optimized for documentation work.

!!! info
    VSCode features like CodeLLDB debug profiles and the default build task (Ctrl+Shift+B) require the workspace root to be your Rust project root-where `Cargo.toml` is located. Open `src` for development and `doc` for documentation to ensure each tool works correctly.

## Debugging
Install the `CodeLLDB` extension for native debugging support. Debug profiles are automatically created when the extension is installed and the `src` folder is opened as your workspace root.

!!! warning
    If debug profiles are not available, run `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Debug: Add Configuration..." to generate them manually.

## Testing and Tasks
Access pre-configured development tasks via `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Run Task". The template includes three essential workflows for automated testing and coverage generation.

## Formatting
The template configures VSCode to format Rust files automatically when saved using `rustfmt`.

## Linting

Lints are checked on save, giving you fast feedback on code quality issues.

/// caption

///

!!! tip

    Combine this with VSCode's `Auto Save` feature for continuous error checking as you type.

    This isn't enforced as it's user preference.

## Coverage
Generate code coverage reports with `cargo-tarpaulin` and visualize them in your editor using `coverage-gutters`.

![Run Coverage Task](../assets/run-coverage-task.avif)
/// caption
Run "Auto Coverage on Save" task via Ctrl+Shift+P → "Run Task"
///

![Preview Coverage Report](../assets/coverage-report.avif)
/// caption
Preview coverage report via Ctrl+Shift+P → "Coverage Gutters: Preview Coverage Report"
///

![Coverage Gutters](../assets/coverage-gutters.avif)
/// caption

Activate with `Ctrl+Shift+P` → `Coverage Gutter: Watch`
///

!!! tip
    Enable `Coverage Gutters: Watch` alongside `Auto Coverage on Save` for live coverage updates as you code.

## Integrate with Non-Template Projects
!!! info
    If your project was not built on Reloaded template, here's how you can recreate the VSCode setup parts.

Copy the template configuration files to your project and install the recommended extensions:

- [templates/library/.vscode/settings.json](https://github.com/Reloaded-Project/reloaded-templates-rust/blob/main/templates/library/.vscode/settings.json) - VSCode settings with `rust-analyzer` and coverage configuration
- [templates/library/.vscode/tasks.json](https://github.com/Reloaded-Project/reloaded-templates-rust/blob/main/templates/library/.vscode/tasks.json) - Pre-configured development tasks

Create a `.vscode` directory in your Rust project root (where `Cargo.toml` is located) and copy these files. Then open your project's folder in VSCode to enable full functionality.

See the [main documentation](../index.md#getting-started) for more details.
